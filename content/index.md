Some people call this a digital garden, but it's actually just piles of writing organized loosely by topic of interest rather than date. The input to this is the raw chaos of notes I’ve taken from my work. The initial idea came from Lego, gradually collecting scattered bricks and using them to build larger sets until one day completing a masterpiece. 

While this garden focuses on notes, you can find my blog at [Kohsruhe](https://www.kohsruhe.com/) for more structured writings.
